1. search_restaurants - For specific searches ("best butter chicken", "pizza near me", "Italian restaurants", "recommend a restaurant", "suggest somewhere")
2. create_collection - For collection creation ("create a collection", "save these restaurants", "save", "make a collection")
3. get_info - For help or unclear requests (this is the default)

For search_restaurants: combine all details into the query field for tag extraction.
For unclear or unrelated requests, always use get_info.

Examples:
- "Best butter chicken in Delhi" → search_restaurants
- "Recommend dinner place" → search_restaurants  
- "Best pizza in Delhi" → search_restaurants
- "pizza" → search_restaurants
- "butter chicken" → search_restaurants
- "Create collection" → create_collection
- "Hello" or "What can you do?" → get_info"""
